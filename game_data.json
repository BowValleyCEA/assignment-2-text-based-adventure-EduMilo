  "Introduction": "Sometime in the 3020s, Maritans ran out of wars to fight at home.\nThe Martian economy thrived and food scarcity was no longer an issue.\nThis, of course, was regarded as ‘not good’ by the politicians and big-wigs of Mars.\nIn a matter of years, Mars sent out countless vessels to all corners of the solar system in search of more life to create arbitrary conflict with.\nAboard these vessels were crews of the highest-calibre men the Martian army had to offer.\nThese crews, consisting vastly more of muscle than brain, often vanish into corners of space, costing in millions of Taxpayer Marsbucks being lost.\nTo counteract this economic loss, Mars sends out military inspectors to find these ships and bring back their Vessel Cores.\nYou are one of these inspectors.",
